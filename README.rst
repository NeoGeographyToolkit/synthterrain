============

The synthterrain package is software to support the creation of synthetic
terrain on worlds in the solar system.

At the moment, this repo is under significant development and change as we
attempt to craft various pieces of code.  It is very messy and a work-in-process.
Nothing is guaranteed about structure until we pass the 1.0 version.

It currently contains only Python code, but we anticipate the addition of C++
for certain functionality.
